📝 Project Overview
This project is designed to assist financial institutions in automating the loan approval process. Using historical data from previous applicants, we train various machine learning models to accurately predict whether a loan application should be approved or rejected.

The objective is to build a robust classification model that can identify high-risk and low-risk applicants, thus saving time and minimizing financial risk.

📊 Problem Statement
Goal: Predict whether a loan should be approved based on applicant details.

Business Impact: Helps banks improve operational efficiency, reduce defaults, and offer better customer service.

📁 Dataset Features (Example Fields)
Gender, Marital Status

Applicant Income, Coapplicant Income

Loan Amount, Loan Term

Credit History

Property Area

Loan Status (Target Variable)

🛠 Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook

Machine Learning Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.

Model Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix

✅ Key Results
Accuracy Achieved: e.g., 85% (adjust this with your actual result)

Best Model: Random Forest / XGBoost (based on F1-Score and Recall)

Insights:

Credit history is the most influential feature.

Income and loan amount significantly affect approval decisions.
